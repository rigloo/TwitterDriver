# TwitterDriver

I wrote this program for my 2nd semester Java programming class. It uses the libraries provided by http://twitter4j.org/en/ in order to analyze Donald Trump's tweets. It seeks to find if Donald Trump gets more interaction on his tweets if he mentions "Hillary Clinton" in them. Admittedly, since I was fairly new to programming at the time, it is kind of a mess but still I stand by it.
